h1. Supported Events

There are 3 types of events:

* Configuration change event.
* Features repository added/removed event.
* Features installed/uninstalled event.

For each of the vent types above a group may be configured to enabled synchronization, and to provide a whitelis/blacklist of specific event ids.

For instance, the default group is configured to allow synchronization of configuration. This means that whenever a change occurs via the config admin to a specific PID, the change will pass to the distributed memory of the default group and will also be boardcasted to all other default group members using the topic.

This is happening for all PIDs but not for org.apache.karaf.cellar.node which is marked as blacklisted and will never be written or read from the distributed memory, nor will boardcasted via the topic.

The user can add/remove any PID he wishes to the whitelist/blacklist.
