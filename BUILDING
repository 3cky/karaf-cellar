Building Apache Karaf Cellar
============================

Initial Setup
-------------

1) Install J2SE 5.0 SDK (or later), which can be downloaded from
   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jdk5-jsp-142662.html.
   Use version of "JDK 5.0 Update 22" (or later).

2) Make sure that your JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the newly installed
   JDK location, and that your PATH includes %JAVA_HOME%\bin (windows) or
   $JAVA_HOME$/bin (unix).

3) Install Maven 2.2.1 (or later), which can be downloaded from
   http://maven.apache.org/download.html. Make sure that your PATH includes
   the MVN_HOME/bin directory.


Building
--------

1) Checkout Apache Karaf Cellar source using subversion:

        $> svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/karaf/cellar/tags/cellar-2.2.1

2) Run

         $> mvn

   This will compile Apache Karaf Cellar and run all of the tests in the
   Apache Karaf source distribution.
3) Apache Karaf Cellar is now present in your local maven repository. Read the README file
   to install Cellar into a running Apache Karaf instance.
